# Hey, I'm Steven Toben.
I'm a 23 year old Full-Stack Software Engineer.

I have professional experience at top tech companies such as Amazon, as well as other Fortune 500 companies.

I have a passion for learning new technologies and continuously building my skillset. I stay up to date with the latest technologies, but I also make sure to keep improving my skills with mature and proven technologies. 

I have experience with most mainstream languages and technologies. I believe in having a strong foundation in the fundamentals and concepts of programming and software engineering, as this makes switching between languages and learning new technologies very simple. With that said, I tend to gravitate towards certain languages and technologies as they provide my favorite developer experience.

Technology-wise, these are my go-tos and my specialties:
  - ReactJS (and JSX and HTML)
  - TypeScript (and JavaScript)
  - Java
  - Spring Boot/Spring Data/Spring Security (Java)
  - Sass (and CSS)
  - NodeJS and Express
  - NestJS (TypeScript framework for Express run with NodeJS)
  - Angular
  - SQL (PostgreSQL and SQL Server)
  - Redis
  - MongoDB
  - DynamoDB
  - Docker and Docker Compose
  - AWS services

My latest interests are:
  - Kubernetes
  - Quarkus (Java)
  - ElasticSearch
  - Kafka
  - General software architecture and engineering
