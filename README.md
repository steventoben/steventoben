# Hey, I'm Steven Toben.
I'm a 22 year old Full-Stack Software Engineer.

I have experience at top tech companies such as Amazon.

I'm currently working on a few personal projects for fun:
  - Social media web app (ReactJS/TypeScript/Sass/NestJS/NodeJS/Express/PostgreSQL/Redis/Neo4j)
  - Real time websockets chat app (mainly an expiriment to implement real-time updates for my social media app) (mainly React/Nest/Redis)
  - Admin dashboard with rich text editor (for improving social media app's post editor and a future blog project) (NextJS/Meta's Lexical)
  - Personal design system and React component library
  - Various React modules
